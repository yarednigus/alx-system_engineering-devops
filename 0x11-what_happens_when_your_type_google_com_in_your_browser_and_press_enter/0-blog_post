[200~When you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter, several steps occur behind the scenes:

DNS Request: Your browser initiates a Domain Name System (DNS) request to translate the human-readable domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address. This request is typically handled by your operating system's DNS resolver or a DNS server provided by your ISP. Once resolved, the IP address is returned to the browser.

TCP/IP Connection: With the IP address of Google's server obtained, your browser establishes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with that server. TCP ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data between your browser and the server.

Firewall: If there's a firewall in place, it may inspect the outgoing request to ensure it complies with network security policies. If everything is in order, the request is allowed to proceed.

HTTPS/SSL Handshake: Since you entered "https://" in the URL, your browser knows to use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to communicate with the server securely. This involves an SSL/TLS handshake process, where your browser and the server negotiate encryption parameters, exchange digital certificates to authenticate each other, and establish a secure connection.

Load Balancer: Google likely employs load balancers to distribute incoming web traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and optimal performance. The load balancer receives the request from your browser and forwards it to one of Google's servers based on various algorithms and current server loads.

Web Server: Once the request reaches one of Google's web servers, it processes the request. In this case, since you requested "www.google.com," the web server may serve a landing page or redirect you to a localized version of Google's search page based on your geographical location or other factors.

Application Server: Behind the scenes, Google's application servers handle the logic and processing required for various Google services, such as search, Gmail, Maps, etc. Depending on the specific request, the application server retrieves or generates the necessary data and sends it back to the web server for delivery to your browser.

Database: In some cases, the application server may need to fetch or store data in a database to fulfill your request. This could involve retrieving search results from an index, fetching user information, or storing data submitted through a form. Google likely employs highly scalable and distributed databases to handle the enormous volume of data generated by its services.

Overall, this process involves a complex interplay of various components working together seamlessly to deliver the requested web page or service to your browser.
